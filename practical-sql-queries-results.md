## üìù Sample Queries and Results

| Use Case | Query | Result |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Select all employees** | `SELECT * FROM Employees;` | Returns all 10 rows from Employees. |
| **Filter by salary** | `SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 55000;` | Bob, Diana, George, Hannah, Jane |
| **Group by department** | `SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS num_employees FROM Employees GROUP BY department_id;` | 1:2, 2:4, 3:2, 4:2 |
| **Filter groups with HAVING** | `SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM Employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING avg_salary > 55000;` | Departments 2 and 3 |
| **Order employees by salary descending** | `SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC;` | George, Diana, Jane, Bob, Hannah, Charlie, Ian, Alice, Fiona, Ethan |
| **INNER JOIN (employees with departments)** | `SELECT e.name, d.department_name FROM Employees e INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;` | All employees matched with their department names. |
| **LEFT JOIN (all employees)** | `SELECT e.name, d.department_name FROM Employees e LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;` | Same as INNER JOIN since all employees have a department. |
| **RIGHT JOIN (all departments)** | `SELECT e.name, d.department_name FROM Employees e RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;` | All departments, plus employees where available. |
| **FULL JOIN** | `SELECT e.name, d.department_name FROM Employees e FULL JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;` | All employees and departments, with NULLs if no match (none here). |
| **Count employees in IT** | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees WHERE department_id = 2;` | 4 |
| **Sum of salaries in HR** | `SELECT SUM(salary) FROM Employees WHERE department_id = 1;` | 102000 |
| **Average salary in Finance** | `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees WHERE department_id = 3;` | 72500 |
| **Minimum salary overall** | `SELECT MIN(salary) FROM Employees;` | 45000 |
| **Maximum salary overall** | `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees;` | 75000 |

## üîë Key Concepts
## üóÇÔ∏è SQL Keywords Explained (Interview Style)

| Keyword | Interview Answer |
|---------|------------------|
| **SELECT** | "SELECT is used to retrieve specific columns or all columns from one or more tables. It‚Äôs the most basic SQL statement to pull data you need." |
| **FROM** | "FROM specifies the table(s) where the data is stored. It tells SQL which table to query data from." |
| **WHERE** | "WHERE filters the result set based on conditions. It allows you to select only those rows that meet your criteria." |
| **GROUP BY** | "GROUP BY groups rows that have the same values in specified columns. It‚Äôs used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc." |
| **HAVING** | "HAVING filters groups after they‚Äôve been formed by GROUP BY. It‚Äôs like WHERE but applies to aggregated results." |
| **ORDER BY** | "ORDER BY sorts the result set in ascending (default) or descending order based on one or more columns." |
| **INNER JOIN** | "INNER JOIN returns rows where there‚Äôs a match in both tables based on a specified condition, like a shared key." |
| **LEFT JOIN** | "LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table, and matches from the right table where possible; unmatched rows from the right table will have NULLs." |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | "RIGHT JOIN is the opposite of LEFT JOIN. It returns all rows from the right table, plus matches from the left table; unmatched rows from the left table will have NULLs." |
| **FULL JOIN** | "FULL JOIN returns all rows from both tables. When there‚Äôs no match, it returns NULLs in the columns from the missing table." |
| **COUNT()** | "COUNT() returns the number of rows that match a given condition or the total number of rows if no condition is specified." |
| **SUM()** | "SUM() calculates the total of numeric column values." |
| **AVG()** | "AVG() returns the average value of a numeric column." |
| **MIN() / MAX()** | "MIN() returns the smallest value in a column; MAX() returns the largest value." |
